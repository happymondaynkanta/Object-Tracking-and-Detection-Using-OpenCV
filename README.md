# Object-Tracking-and-Detection-Using-OpenCV
Object tracking is one such application of computer vision where an object is detected in a video, otherwise interpreted as a set of frames, and the object’s trajectory is estimated. For instance, you have a video of a baseball match, and you want to track the ball’s location constantly throughout the video.
