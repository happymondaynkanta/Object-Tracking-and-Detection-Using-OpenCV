# Object-Tracking-and-Detection-Using-OpenCV
Object tracking is one such application of computer vision where an object is detected in a video, otherwise interpreted as a set of frames, and the object’s trajectory is estimated. For instance, you have a video of a baseball match, and you want to track the ball’s location constantly throughout the video.

## OpenCV-based object tracking
Object tracking using OpenCV is a popular method that is extensively used in the domain. OpenCV has a number of built-in functions specifically designed for the purpose of object tracking. Some object trackers in OpenCV include MIL, CSRT, GOTURN, and MediandFlow. Selecting a specific tracker depends on the application you are trying to design. Each tracker has its advantages and disadvantages, and a single type of tracker is not desired in all the applications.
